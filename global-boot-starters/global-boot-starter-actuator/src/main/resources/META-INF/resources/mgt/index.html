                        <p>This endpoint is a report on the Spring Boot auto-configuration process that happened when
                            your application started up. It lists all the
                            <code>@Conditional</code> annotations that were evaluated as the context started and in each
                            case it gives an indication of if (and why) the condition matched. A positive match results
                            in a bean being included in the context, and a negative result
                            means the opposite (the bean’s class may not even be loaded).</p>

                        <p>The report is split into 2 parts, positive matches first, and then negative. If the context
                            is a hierarchy, there is also a separate report on the parent context with the same format
                            (and recursively up to the top of the hierarchy).</p>

                        <code>Environment</code> on startup, so they reflect the externalised configuration of the
                        application. Beans are listed by name. A bean that is added using
                        <code>@EnableConfigurationProperties</code> will have a conventional name:
                        <code>&lt;prefix&gt;.CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES</code>, where
                        <code>&lt;prefix&gt;</code> is the environment key prefix specified in the

                        state and stack. It is the same information as you would get from
                        <code>kill -3</code> of a running Java process. It can be very useful for detecting issues at
                        runtime, especially sluggish behaviour caused by threads blocked by slow or unavailable I/O
                        (e.g. if a connection pool is exhausted).</p></td>

                        <code>@Value</code>). Normally you will see the Java

                            “DOWN”=503). The mappings can be changed by configuring
